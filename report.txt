Challenges so far:
- I defaulted to using a Map for the adjacency list, but then after rereading the slides I switched to a matrix
-I struggled a bit with the design of the program. I wasn't sure to just use a collection of methods, or put it into a class
-I noticed that in the in-class explanation, once the node was popped off as visited, it went to the shortest path. but since there can be multiple shortest paths, I can't do that.
